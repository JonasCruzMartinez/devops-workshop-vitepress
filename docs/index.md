# DevOps Workshop

Welcome to the DevOps Workshop site.

This interactive VitePress site is your workshop guide! Fork the repo, implement CI/CD, and deploy to GitHub Pages. Edit pages here to practice "Code" phase—merge and see live updates at `https://undead2146.github.io/devops-workshop-vitepress/`.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Fork from main branch: [GitHub Fork Button].
2. Clone: `git clone <your-fork-url>`.
3. Install: `pnpm install`.
4. Local dev server: `pnpm dev` (localhost:5173 – live reload on edits).
5. Enable Pages: Repo Settings > Pages > Source: Deploy from branch `gh-pages`.
6. Follow sidebar: Theory for concepts, Hands-On for implementation.
