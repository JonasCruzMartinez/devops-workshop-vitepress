  <p>Automatically deploy to production with GitHub Pages</p>
</div>

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this phase, you will:
- ‚úÖ Implement automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ Understand continuous deployment principles
- ‚úÖ Experience the complete CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Complete your DevOps workshop journey
- ‚úÖ Finalize your progress tracker as a DevOps achievement

## Theory: Why the Deploy Phase Matters

### The Problem Without Automated Deployment
Manual deployment processes are error-prone and slow:
- üö® Manual steps lead to inconsistent deployments
- üö® Deployment becomes a bottleneck in the development process
- üö® Risk of human error in production releases
- üö® No automatic rollback capabilities

### The DevOps Solution: Continuous Deployment

The Deploy phase embodies **Automation** and **Lean** from the CALMS framework:

  D -->|Yes| E[Deploy to Production]
  D -->|No| F[Block Deployment]
  E --> G[Live Site Updated]
  F --> H[Fix Issues & Retry]
```

## Hands-On Practice: Complete Your CI/CD Pipeline

### Step 1: Add Deploy Job to Workflow
<div class="step-counter">1</div>

Add the deploy job to your `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Add this job after your existing jobs
deploy:
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
  needs: [build, test]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup pnpm
      uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      with:
        version: 8
        
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 18
        cache: 'pnpm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      
    - name: Build site
      run: pnpm build
      
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        publish_dir: .vitepress/dist
        cname: # Optional: add custom domain
```

### Step 2: Test the Full Pipeline
<div class="step-counter">2</div>

Let's test your complete CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# Create a branch for final updates
git checkout -b feat/complete-pipeline

# Add the deploy job
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Update your progress tracker to show completion
# Edit docs/progress.md and mark Phase 5 as complete

# Commit all changes
git commit -m "feat: complete CI/CD pipeline with deployment

- Added automated deployment to GitHub Pages
- Updated progress tracker with Phase 5 completion
- Ready for full pipeline test"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feat/complete-pipeline
```

### Step 3: Merge and Watch the Magic
<div class="step-counter">3</div>

1. **Create and merge your PR** to main
2. **Watch GitHub Actions** run the complete pipeline:
   - Build ‚úÖ
   - Test ‚úÖ  
   - Deploy ‚úÖ
3. **Visit your live site**: `https://[your-username].github.io/devops-workshop-vitepress/`

<div class="success-box">
üéâ <strong>DevOps Magic Moment:</strong> Your changes are now automatically live! Every future edit to main will build, test, and deploy automatically.
</div>

### Step 4: Celebrate and Document Your Achievement
